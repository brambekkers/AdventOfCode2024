# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## About Me

Hello! I'm Bram Bekkers, a front-end developer with a passion for crafting seamless user experiences using JavaScript and TypeScript. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve been part of a fantastic team at ABN AMRO, where we focus on building intuitive dashboards for our business clients (IBB Overview and Navigation). We use Vue.js as our main tool. I'm thrilled to be participating in the Advent of Code this year, and I can't wait to flex my coding muscles on these daily puzzles!

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new problem is released, and participants from around the world solve these puzzles using their favorite programming languages. It's a fantastic way to hone your skills, learn new techniques, and join a vibrant community of problem solvers.

## Repository Structure

This repository is where I will be documenting my solutions to each day's challenge. You'll find my code organized by day, along with any notes or explanations Iâ€™ve found relevant during my problem-solving process.
